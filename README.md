# <b>Wheel of Fortune Game</b> ðŸŽ¡
<hr>

## Overview

The objective of this project was to branch out and create a game that was MVC (Mode View Control) architecture, given the recommended selection of games or we were given an alternate option, to choose a similar game not on the list, whereas we were expected to present our case on how the logic would work and what the game's objectivity would be.

I chose the latter, which is a Wheel of Fortune. This game is one version that spins random numbers within an array of values. There are <b>many</b> different versions of this
game. In hopes of succeeding, I went with a wheel that could change the value in a credit box. My inspiration was a casino style game where there's infinite possibilites 
depending on how much money you're willing to spend!
